abstract: Divergence is used to measure the difference of two systems, and it is widely applied in many fields. To solve this problem more efficiently, Dempster–Shafer evidence theory has been proposed, different from the traditional probability distribution, and because of its processing advantages of uncertainty, has been widely used in many aspects of reality. In this paper, a new method of belief divergence measure of mass functions is proposed, named as Earth Mover’s divergence of belief function, which is a generalization of Earth Mover’s distance (Wasserstein distance). Compared with other existing methods of divergence measuring, the EM divergence can show good performance in the presence of higher degrees of uncertainty and more conflicts. Numerical examples help have a better understanding of the Earth Mover’s divergence of belief function. Based on the new method of belief divergence measure, there is a combination model proposed to address the problem of data fusion. Application in target recognition is used to show the efficiency of the proposed method of divergence measure.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: So as to resolve the issue of divergence measure among the evidence from different sources, the contributions of this paper are that a new method of measuring the evidence divergence of BPAs is proposed, named as Earth Mover’s divergence of belief function. This divergence method is the generalization of Earth Mover’s distance(Wasserstein distance) Arjovsky et al. (2017) which can still provide a meaningful and smooth representation of the distance between two probability assignment in lower dimensional manifolds without overlaps. There is a signiﬁcant difference between EM divergence and EMD because it has been improved on the basis of EMD to be more suitable for the evidence measuring. EMD is independent of the order of the elements in the probability distributions and EM divergence require that the focal elements of two BPAs must corresponding to each other. Moreover, compared with other existing methods of divergence measuring, the EM divergence can show good performance in the presence of higher degrees of uncertainty and more conﬂicts. The example application of target recognition which is on the basis of data fusion has illustrated that the proposed divergence can get the highest reliability to the correct target.
